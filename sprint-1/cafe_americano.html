                Caffè Americano (also known as Americano or American) is a type of coffee drink <br> prepared by diluting an espresso with hot water, giving it a similar strength to, but <br>different flavor from, traditionally brewed coffee. The strength of an Americano <br>varies with the number of shots of espresso and the amount of water added.
                The <br> drink consists of a single or double shot of espresso brewed with added water. <br> Typically in the UK (and in Italy) between 1 and 16 imperial fluid ounces or 28 <br> and 455 ml of hot water is added to the double espresso.
                Americanos—particularly <br> short long-black-style Americanos—are also used within artisanal espresso preparation <br>for beans that produce strong espresso. This is particularly  used for single origin  <br> espresso,where many find that undiluted espresso shots can prove overpowering and <br> with lighter coffees and roasts not generally associated with espresso, such as beans of <br> Ethiopian or Sumatran origins. For this preparation, generally a ratio of 1:1 espresso to <br> water is used, to prevent excess dilution,with the espresso pulled directly into a cup with <br> water to  minimize disruption to the crema.
