                Capuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink that originated in Italy, and is traditionally <br> prepared with steamed milk foam (microfoam).Variations of the drink involve the use of <br> cream instead of milk, and flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder.It is typically <br> smaller in volume than a caffè latte, with a thicker layer of microfoam.The name comes <br> from the Capuchin friars, referring to the colour of their habits,and in this context <br> referring to the colour of the beverage when milk is added in small portion to dark,<br> brewed coffee (today mostly espresso).
                The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino <br>with espresso créma and steamed milk is a result of a long evolution of the drink.The <br> Viennese bestowed the name "Kapuziner", possibly in the 18th century, on a version that <br> included whipped cream and spices of unknown origin. The Italian cappuccino was unknown <br> outside Italy until the 1930s, and seems to be born out of Viennese-style cafés in Trieste <br> and other cities in the former Austria in the first decades of the 20th century. The drink <br> has since spread worldwide and can be found at a number of establishments.
